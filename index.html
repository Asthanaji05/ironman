              Iron Man’s dream is to build a bunch of robots that would do all the work for him while he sits on his couch and eats cheeseburgers.
               He also dreams of being the coolest, smartest, and richest guy in the world who can make fun of anyone he wants.
                He dreams of having  a talking computer, and a flying car.
                 He dreams of being awesome, witty, and handsome, but also having a heart of gold. He dreams of being Iron Man,

                Iron Man is a superhero who started out as a weapons dealer but then had a change of heart.
                 Literally. He built himself a metal suit with a mini reactor in his chest that keeps him alive and 
                 powers his gadgets. He also built a global empire, a bunch of flying robots, and a supercomputer that 
                 talks back to him. He is a genius, a leader, and a snarky jerk who likes to save the world from aliens,
                  robots, and his own mistakes. He is also friends with a super soldier, a thunder god, and a green rage monster
